# Using the TrinTheremin

## Basic Steps
1. Ensure there is a fresh 9v battery installed in the TrinTheremin and **Turn on the Power Switch**.
2. The flashing lights indicate a 5 second Calibration Mode. **Calibrate the TrinTheremin** by first pressing the photoresistor to indicate a minimum value, then by removing any obstacle from blocking the photoresistor to allow the ambient light in the room to indicate a maximum value.
3. Use your hand to **Play the TrinTheremin** 

## Activities
1. Experiment with the other switches, sliders, buttons, and LED's on the TrinTheremin. What is the purpose of each? Hand-draw a diagram of the top of the TrinTheremin. Label all components used for input/output.
