# Using the TrinTheremin

## Basic Steps
1. **Turn on the Power Switch**. Ensure there is a fresh 9v battery installed in the TrinTheremin.
2. **Calibrate the TrinTheremin**. The flashing LED's indicate a 5 second Calibration Mode.  First, press the photoresistor to indicate a minimum value. Then, remove any obstacle from blocking the photoresistor to allow the ambient light in the room to indicate a maximum value.
3. **Play the TrinTheremin**. Be sure to avoid touching the underside of the board. The amplifier cicuit for the speaker can get hot.

## Learning Activities
1. Experiment with the other switches, sliders, buttons, and LED's on the TrinTheremin. What is the purpose of each? Hand-draw a diagram of the top of the TrinTheremin. Label all components used for input/output.
