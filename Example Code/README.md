# Using the TrinTheremin

## Basic Steps
1. Ensure there is a fresh 9v battery installed in the TrinTheremin and **Turn on the Power Switch**.
2. The flashing lights indicate a 5 second Calibration Mode. **Calibrate the TrinTheremin** by first pressing the photoresistor to indicate a minimum value, then by removing any obstacle from blocking the photoresistor to allow the ambient light in the room to indicate a maximum value.
3. Use your hand to **Play the TrinTheremin**
