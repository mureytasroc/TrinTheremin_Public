# Using the TrinTheremin

## Basic Steps
1. **Plug the board into a USB port**. If you want to use the TrinTheremin on battery power: plug in a battery (see home page readme), and turn it on with the power switch.
2. **Calibrate the TrinTheremin**. When the unit first turns on, hold the board normally to allow the sensor to read the ambient light level.   Once the board makes a sound, place your hand over the sensor so it can read a low value.   When the two LEDs stop blinking and flicker the calibration is complete.
3. **Play the TrinTheremin**. Be sure to avoid touching the underside of the board. The amplifier cicuit for the speaker can get hot.

## Learning Activities
1. Experiment with the other switches, sliders, buttons, and LED's on the TrinTheremin. What is the purpose of each? Hand-draw a diagram of the top of the TrinTheremin. 
   - Label all of the TrinTheremin components used for input/output.

2. Examine the code contained in *TrinThereminExampleCode.ino*. This is the code that controls the behavior of the TrinTheremin. It is written in the Arduino programming language because the TrinTheremin essentially embeds an Arduino Micro into a custom circuit board. 
   - Label each component on your hand-drawn diagram with both the pin number and identifier name given to it in *TrinThereminExampleCode.ino*

3. Add two octaves of F Major as a new scale.
   - First, add F Major by replacing the G scale.
   - Then, add back the G scale and incorporate F Major as a fifth option.
   
4. Find the Circuit Design picture of the BoardTop and the BoardBottom.
   - What do the green markings indicate?
   - What do the red markings indicate?
   - What do the white markings indicate?
   - What do the blue markings indicate?
